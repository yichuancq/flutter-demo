yichuandeMacBook-Pro:flutter-demo yichuan$ /Users/yichuan/Documents/flutter/bin/flutter build apk

You are building a fat APK that includes binaries for android-arm, android-arm64.

If you are deploying the app to the Play Store, it's recommended to use app bundles or split the APK to reduce the APK size.

    To generate an app bundle, run:
        flutter build appbundle --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64
        Learn more on: https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle
        
    To split the APKs per ABI, run:
        flutter build apk --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64 --split-per-abi
        Learn more on:  https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-apk-splits#configure-abi-split
